## 💻 Steps Taken
1. **Once logged in, list the contents of the current directory to find inhere:**
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

2. **Change into the inhere directory:**
   ```bash
   cd inhere
   ```

3. **List all files in the directory:**
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
   **You should see something like:**
   ```
   -file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09
   ```

4. **Check the file type of each file to find the human-readable one:**
   ```bash
   file ./*
   ```
   **This will show the file types. Look for "ASCII text" which indicates human-readable content.**

5. **Read the contents of the human-readable file (typically -file07):**
   ```bash
   cat ./-file07
   ```

6. **Copy the password that appears:**
   ```
   lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQVb6bEJ5MBsV15pj
   ```

This password will be used to log into Level 5. Remember to save it.
