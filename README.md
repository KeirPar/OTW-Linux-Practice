# OverTheWire Practice – Linux Privilege Escalation

This repository documents my progress through the **OverTheWire wargames**, focusing on building foundational skills in Linux system administration, command-line proficiency, and privilege escalation techniques for cybersecurity applications.

## Wargames Covered

- **[Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)** – Linux fundamentals, file permissions, and essential shell commands
- **[Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/)** – Binary exploitation and reverse engineering (coming soon)

## Repository Structure

- **`/bandit`** – Comprehensive writeups for each level, including command explanations and methodology
- **`/scripts`** – Custom Bash scripts for task automation and system configuration validation
- **`/notes`** – Curated reference materials on Linux administration and privilege escalation techniques

## Learning Objectives

This practice focuses on developing core cybersecurity skills through hands-on experience with:

- File permission misconfigurations and access control bypass techniques
- SUID binary exploitation and command injection vulnerabilities  
- Advanced Bash scripting and Linux system troubleshooting
- Command-line tool proficiency for security analysis

## Technical Environment

- **Platform**: Linux (Ubuntu VM via VirtualBox)
- **Primary Tools**: Bash, SSH, standard Unix utilities
- **Key Commands**: `strings`, `grep`, `find`, `xargs`, `base64`, `sort`, `uniq`

## Usage

Each level writeup follows a consistent format covering the objective, required commands, step-by-step methodology, and relevant technical concepts. These materials serve as both learning documentation and reference guides for similar challenges.
