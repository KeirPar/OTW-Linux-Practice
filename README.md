# OverTheWire Practice – Linux Privilege Escalation

This repository documents my progress through the **OverTheWire wargames**, focusing on building foundational skills in Linux system administration, command-line proficiency, and privilege escalation techniques for cybersecurity applications. Please note that the passwords displayed for each level are subject to change periodically. Please do not assume they will be the same for you.

## Wargames Covered

- **[Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)** – Linux fundamentals, file permissions, and essential shell commands
- **[Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/)** – Binary exploitation and reverse engineering (coming soon)

## Repository Structure

- **`/bandit`** – Comprehensive writeups for each level, including command explanations and methodology
- **`/narnia`** – Same style of writeups as the bandit levels
- **`/notes`** – Curated reference materials on Linux administration and privilege escalation techniques

## Learning Objectives

This practice focuses on developing core cybersecurity skills through hands-on experience with:

- File permission misconfigurations and access control bypass techniques
- SUID binary exploitation and command injection vulnerabilities  
- Advanced Bash scripting and Linux system troubleshooting
- Command-line tool proficiency for security analysis

## Technical Environment

- **Platform**: Linux (Ubuntu VM via VirtualBox)
- **Primary Tools**: Bash, SSH, standard Unix utilities
- **Key Commands**: `ncat`,`ssh`,`strings`, `grep`, `find`, `nmap`, `base64`, `sort`, `uniq` etc

## Usage

Each level write-up follows a consistent format covering the objective, required commands, step-by-step methodology, and relevant technical concepts. These materials serve as both learning documentation and reference guides for similar challenges.
