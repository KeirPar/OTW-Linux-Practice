# OverTheWire Practice – Linux Privilege Escalation

This repository documents my progress and learnings from completing the **OverTheWire wargames** (starting with Bandit and later moving to Narnia).  
The goal is to **build a solid foundation in Linux, Bash, and privilege escalation techniques** for cybersecurity.

## 🕹️ Wargames Covered
- [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) – basics of Linux, file permissions, and shell commands.
- [Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/) – intro to binary exploitation (coming soon).

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **/bandit** – Writeups for each level solved, including commands used and explanations.
- **/scripts** – Bash scripts I wrote to automate repetitive tasks or check system configurations.
- **/notes** – General Linux & privilege escalation notes I compiled while working through the games.

## 🚀 Why I’m Doing This
I’m learning cybersecurity fundamentals by:
- Practicing **file permission misconfigurations**
- Exploring **SUID binaries & command injection**
- Strengthening my **Bash scripting & Linux troubleshooting** skills

## 🔧 Tech Used
- **Linux (Ubuntu VM in VirtualBox)**
- **Bash**
- **SSH**
- **CTF tools like strings, grep, find, xargs**
